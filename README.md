#DON'T CARE ABOUT <IE9? DON'T NEED OODLES OF FEATURES?

This is Yet Another Slider (YAS). BUT, it is a bit special: it doesn't need jQuery and it only has two key features. I've slung my fair share of sliders, and in my experience, two features are the most important to making clients happy: pagination and dynamic sizing. This slider has those features, and nothing else.
