##DON'T CARE ABOUT <IE9? DON'T NEED OODLES OF FEATURES?

This is Yet Another Slider (YAS). BUT, it is a bit special: it doesn't need jQuery and it only has two key features. I've slung my fair share of sliders, and in my experience, two features are the most important to making clients happy: pagination and dynamic sizing. This slider has those features, and nothing else. Oh, and we do have <IE9 covered. Users get shown the first image in the carousel as a static slide sans any carousel functionality.


##TK

* Multiple sliders per page: Put slider on prototype and instantiate a new instance when init() is called
* Provide callback after slide is done animating. Useful for loading things like video.
* Auto-play
* swipe gestures for touch devices
